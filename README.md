## I learned
- how to use the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to external APIs, including how to set headers, send data, and handle responses.
- Better understanding of Promises, which are returned by the Fetch API and are used to handle asynchronous code. Also how to chain promises and handle errors.
- How to use Typescript with Fetch, including how to define types for request and response objects and how to handle errors and data in a type-safe way.
